Kent United Futsal Club, are a 1 National Men's Tier futsal team currently competing within the FA National Futsal Series in England, United Kingdom. As a club currently under new ownership and management, it is essential for the club to have a website in order to facilitate anything from bringing in new sponsors, fans looking for team information or new players looking to contact the club. 

The website is constructed using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the addition of a backend MySQL database, in order to hold the required club information. The design of the website has been visualised and decided upon using Adobe XD based on the clubs desires and requests for this project.
